# book-sales-rank

## Introduction:
This project aims to leverage Amazon sales rank dataset to analyze and predict factors that influence a book's sales rank, enabling authors, publishers, and marketers to make data-driven decisions to improve visibility and performance. By exploring patterns and trends across different formats, genres, and pricing strategies, the goal is to build predictive models and actionable insights that optimize book rankings and enhance their market competitiveness.

## Problem Statement:
The book market is highly competitive, and authors, publishers, and marketers often struggle to understand the factors that significantly influence a bookâ€™s sales rank and market performance. Despite the availability of large datasets containing various attributes such as book format, genre, pricing, and historical sales data, there is a lack of actionable insights to guide strategic decisions that can improve a book's visibility and ranking. This project aims to address this gap by analyzing key factors that contribute to a book's sales rank, and developing predictive models to provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing book rankings. The goal is to help stakeholders in the book industry make informed decisions that enhance competitiveness, increase sales, and drive better market outcomes.
